This app takes two user inputs: a word that they are searching for, and a string of characters in a sentence that they search in to find the first input word that they chose. The second page displays a results page with the frequency - shown in an integer value - of the number of times their input word appears in the string. 

This app requires a browser, and PHP 5.5 or higher in order to run.
